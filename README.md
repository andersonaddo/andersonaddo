### Hi there! 
<img align="left" src="https://github.com/andersonaddo/andersonaddo/blob/master/hello.gif" height="50" />

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub!
Over the years I've worked on projects in [Unity](https://unity.com/) (I've made many games on Unity), [native Android](https://developer.android.com/studio), [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/) and [PostreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (to name a few).

🌍 My personal website has a lot of info on me, including [from the work I've done](https://www.loadingdeveloper.com/my-work/) and the [blog posts](https://www.loadingdeveloper.com/blog/) I've written. [Check it out!](https://www.loadingdeveloper.com)

#### 🔭 Stuff I'm working on now
I’m currently working on a social media app (startup?) called [Biteup](https://biteup.app). I'm also a co-PM and a developer for an experimental [Care International](https://github.com/yourchoiceyourfuture) project.

#### 🕯️ Stuff I worked on in the not-so-distant past
I used to help maintain [react-native-firebase](https://github.com/invertase/react-native-firebase). I still do, but at a less capacity.
