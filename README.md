### Hi there! 
<img align="left" src="hello.gif" height="50" />

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub!
Over the years I've worked on projects in [Unity](https://unity.com/) (I've made many games on Unity), [native Android](https://developer.android.com/studio), [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/) and [PostreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (to name a few).

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a social media app called [Biteup](https://github.com/biteup). I'm also helping maintain [react-native-firebase](https://github.com/invertase/react-native-firebase).
- 🌍 My personal website has a lot of info on me, including [from the work I've done](https://www.loadingdeveloper.com/my-work/) and the [blog posts](https://www.loadingdeveloper.com/my-work/) I've written. [Check it out!](https://www.loadingdeveloper.com)

P.S: I also have a few open source things on [Bitbucket](bitbucket.org/andersonaddo), if that's your thing. 😑
