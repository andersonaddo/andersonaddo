### Hi there! 
<img align="left" src="https://github.com/andersonaddo/andersonaddo/blob/master/media/hello.gif" height="50" />

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub!
Over the years I've worked on projects in [Unity](https://unity.com/) (I've made many games on Unity), [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), [native Android](https://developer.android.com/studio), [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/), [PostreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and [THREE.js](https://threejs.org/) (non-exhaustive).

üåç My personal website has a lot of info on me, including [from the work I've done](https://www.loadingdeveloper.com/my-work/) and the [blog posts](https://www.loadingdeveloper.com/blog/) I've written (though I don't write very often). [Check it out!](https://www.loadingdeveloper.com)

In the summer of 2021, I was an intern in Seattle in the [Amazon Timestream](https://aws.amazon.com/timestream/) Storage & Ingestion team. I built a pretty cool  visualizer to help their developers understand how their massive production-scale tables are partitioned.
